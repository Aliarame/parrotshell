Parrot In The Shell  

Aims to achieve the same goal as [`parrot.live`](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live), but ensures it can be run directly from a GitHub link or within a single file.  

## Running it
  
*Still a WIP (Right now write "parrot" using colors from the terminal while moving from left to right)*  
  
Run it in one command without any download (Please [review the script](https://github.com/Aliarame/parrotshell/blob/main/parrotshell.sh) before running it) :   
```
bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aliarame/parrotshell/main/parrotshell.sh)
```
  
## Credits  

* [`parrot.live`](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live) for the original concept  
* [`terminal-parrot`](https://github.com/jmhobbs/terminal-parrot) for the animation frames

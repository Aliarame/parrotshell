Parrot In The Shell  

Aims to achieve the same goal as [`parrot.live`](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live), but ensures it can be run directly from a GitHub link or within a single file.  
  
*Still a WIP*  
*Right now : Write "parrot" using colors from the terminal while moving from left to right*  
  
Run it in one command without any download (Please review the script before running it) :   
```
bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aliarame/parrotshell/main/parrotshell.sh)
```
